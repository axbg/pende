## An easy-to-use, experimental web-based IDE

The app was developed as part of **BUES' Student Scientific Communication Sessions 2019** organized by **The Faculty of Economic Cybernetics, Statistics and Informatics** and [won the first place](http://csie.ase.ro/sesiune-stiintifica-studenteasca)

The app is built using Node.js/Express, Socket.io & Angular and supports C and C++, but can be easily extended to multiple languages due to its modular approach 

Besides a configurable text editor based on [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/), *pende* features a minimal file manager & basic debug support
